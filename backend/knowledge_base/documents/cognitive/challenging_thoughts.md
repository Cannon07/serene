# Challenging Anxious Thoughts While Driving

## Overview
Anxiety often comes with catastrophic thoughts: "What if I crash?", "I can't do this", "Something bad will happen." This technique helps you challenge and reframe these thoughts.

## Common Anxious Driving Thoughts

### "I'm going to crash"
**Challenge**: "I have driven many times without crashing. I am alert and paying attention. Most drives are uneventful."

### "I can't handle this"
**Challenge**: "I have handled difficult things before. I am handling this moment right now. I can pull over if I need to."

### "Everyone is watching me / judging me"
**Challenge**: "Other drivers are focused on their own driving. No one is paying special attention to me."

### "What if I panic?"
**Challenge**: "I have felt anxious before and it passed. Panic is uncomfortable but not dangerous. I have tools to help."

## The STOP Technique
1. **S** - Stop the thought (notice you're having it)
2. **T** - Take a breath
3. **O** - Observe the thought (don't judge it)
4. **P** - Proceed with a balanced thought

## Audio Script
"I notice you might be having some worried thoughts. That's normal.
Let's take a breath together first.
Now, what's the thought? Is it 'something bad will happen' or 'I can't do this'?
Here's the truth: You are driving right now. You are doing it.
Most drives - millions of them every day - happen without incident.
You are alert. You are careful. You have skills.
The anxious thought is just a thought, not a prediction.
Let it pass like a cloud, and refocus on the road ahead."
