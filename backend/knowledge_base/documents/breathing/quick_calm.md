# Quick Calm Breath (Emergency Technique)

## Overview
This is a rapid calming technique for moments of acute anxiety or panic while driving. It takes only 30 seconds and can prevent escalation.

## Instructions
1. Take one **long, deep breath in** (5 seconds)
2. **Hold briefly** (2 seconds)
3. **Sigh out loudly** through your mouth (let it all go)
4. **Repeat twice** more
5. Then return to normal breathing

## Why It Works
- The sigh triggers a physiological relaxation response
- Quick enough for acute moments
- The audible exhale releases physical tension
- Three repetitions are enough to interrupt panic

## When to Use
- Sudden anxiety spike while driving
- After a near-miss or honking incident
- When you feel panic starting
- Before entering a highway or difficult situation

## Audio Script
"I'm here with you. Let's take a quick calming breath.
Big breath in... hold it...
Now sigh it all out... ahhhh...
Good. Again. Deep breath in...
Hold...
Sigh it out... release everything...
One more. Breathe in deep...
Hold...
And let it all go...
You're okay. You're doing great."
