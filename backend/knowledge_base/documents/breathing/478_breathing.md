# 4-7-8 Breathing Technique

## Overview
The 4-7-8 breathing technique, also known as relaxing breath, is a simple yet powerful method to calm your nervous system quickly. It was developed by Dr. Andrew Weil based on pranayama yoga practices.

## Instructions
1. **Breathe in** quietly through your nose for **4 seconds**
2. **Hold** your breath for **7 seconds**
3. **Exhale** completely through your mouth for **8 seconds**
4. **Repeat** the cycle 3-4 times

## Why It Works
- The extended exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system
- The hold allows oxygen to saturate your bloodstream
- The counting occupies your mind, breaking anxious thought loops
- Regular practice makes it more effective over time

## Driving Adaptation
When using while driving:
- Keep your eyes open and focused on the road
- Breathe through your nose only (skip the whoosh sound on exhale)
- Use mental counts: "In-2-3-4, Hold-2-3-4-5-6-7, Out-2-3-4-5-6-7-8"
- Complete 2-3 cycles rather than 4
- Pull over if you need to close your eyes

## Audio Script
"Let's practice 4-7-8 breathing together. Keep your eyes on the road.
Breathe in through your nose... 2... 3... 4...
Now hold gently... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...
And slowly breathe out... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8...
You're doing great. Let's do one more cycle.
Breathe in... 2... 3... 4...
Hold... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...
And out... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8...
Well done. You're in control."
