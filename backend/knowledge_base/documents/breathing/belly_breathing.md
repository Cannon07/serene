# Belly (Diaphragmatic) Breathing

## Overview
Belly breathing, or diaphragmatic breathing, is the most natural way to breathe. Babies do it automatically. When stressed, we often switch to shallow chest breathing, which can increase anxiety. This technique returns you to natural, calming breath.

## Instructions
1. Place one hand on your chest, one on your belly (if safe)
2. **Breathe in slowly** through your nose, letting your belly expand
3. Your chest should stay relatively still
4. **Breathe out slowly** through your mouth, letting belly fall
5. Focus on the rise and fall of your belly

## Why It Works
- Activates the vagus nerve and parasympathetic system
- Increases oxygen exchange in the lungs
- Naturally slows heart rate
- Returns breathing to its natural state

## Driving Adaptation
- Keep both hands on the wheel
- Imagine your belly pushing toward the steering wheel as you inhale
- Feel your belly move away from the wheel as you exhale
- No need for hand placement while driving

## Audio Script
"Let's breathe from your belly. This is how your body naturally wants to breathe.
Take a slow breath in through your nose... let your belly expand...
Now slowly release... let your belly relax back...
Again, breathe in... feel your belly rise...
And out... feel it fall...
This is your body's natural calming response. Keep going at your own pace."
