# Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)

## Overview
Box breathing, also called square breathing, is used by Navy SEALs and first responders to stay calm under pressure. It's called "box" breathing because each phase is equal, like the sides of a square.

## Instructions
1. **Breathe in** for **4 seconds**
2. **Hold** for **4 seconds**
3. **Breathe out** for **4 seconds**
4. **Hold** (lungs empty) for **4 seconds**
5. **Repeat** 4-6 cycles

## Why It Works
- Equal intervals create rhythm and predictability
- The empty-lung hold is unique and very grounding
- Used by military and athletes for high-stress situations
- Can be done anywhere without drawing attention

## Driving Adaptation
Perfect for driving because:
- Simple counting pattern is easy to remember
- Doesn't require closing eyes
- Can be done at red lights or in traffic
- Subtle enough that passengers won't notice

## Audio Script
"Let's try box breathing. This is what Navy SEALs use to stay calm.
Breathe in... 2... 3... 4...
Hold... 2... 3... 4...
Breathe out... 2... 3... 4...
Hold empty... 2... 3... 4...
Again. In... 2... 3... 4...
Hold... 2... 3... 4...
Out... 2... 3... 4...
Hold... 2... 3... 4...
Excellent. You've got this."
