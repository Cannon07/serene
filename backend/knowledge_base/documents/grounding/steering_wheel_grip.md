# Steering Wheel Grounding

## Overview
This is a driving-specific grounding technique that uses the steering wheel as an anchor point. It's discreet and can be done without anyone noticing.

## Instructions
1. Notice the **texture** of your steering wheel
2. Feel the **temperature** - is it warm or cool?
3. Notice the **shape** and curve under your fingers
4. Squeeze firmly for **3 seconds**, then release
5. **Repeat** the squeeze-release 3 times

## Why It Works
- Tactile focus interrupts anxious thoughts
- The steering wheel is always there - a constant anchor
- Squeeze-release mimics progressive muscle relaxation
- Completely safe to do while driving

## When to Use
- When anxious thoughts spiral
- Before entering a highway
- After a stressful moment on the road
- Anytime you need to feel more present

## Variations
- **Finger tap**: Tap each finger on the wheel, counting 1-10
- **Texture trace**: Trace the stitching pattern with your thumb
- **Temperature notice**: Focus on how the wheel temperature changes

## Audio Script
"Let's use your steering wheel to ground yourself.
Feel the texture under your hands. Notice if it's smooth, textured, or has stitching.
Is it warm or cool? Just notice.
Now squeeze the wheel firmly... hold for 3... 2... 1... and release.
Again, squeeze... hold... and release.
One more time. Squeeze... hold... and release.
Feel how your hands are connected to the car. You're in control."
