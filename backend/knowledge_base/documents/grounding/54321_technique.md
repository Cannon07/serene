# 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique

## Overview
This sensory grounding technique uses your five senses to bring you back to the present moment. It's particularly effective during panic, dissociation, or overwhelming anxiety while driving.

## Instructions
Name out loud or in your mind:
- **5 things** you can SEE
- **4 things** you can TOUCH/FEEL
- **3 things** you can HEAR
- **2 things** you can SMELL
- **1 thing** you can TASTE

## Driving-Specific Examples

### 5 Things You Can SEE
- The road ahead
- Your dashboard
- The sky through the windshield
- The car in front of you
- Your hands on the wheel

### 4 Things You Can FEEL
- The steering wheel under your hands
- Your back against the seat
- The seatbelt across your chest
- Your foot on the pedal

### 3 Things You Can HEAR
- The engine running
- Wind or traffic sounds
- Music or radio (if on)

### 2 Things You Can SMELL
- The car interior
- Air freshener or outside air

### 1 Thing You Can TASTE
- Your last drink
- Gum or mint
- Just notice your mouth

## Why It Works
- Engages your rational brain through sensory observation
- Interrupts the anxiety spiral by redirecting attention
- Grounds you firmly in the present moment
- Works quickly (1-3 minutes)

## Audio Script
"Let's ground ourselves in this moment. Keep your eyes on the road.
Name 5 things you can see... the road... your dashboard... the sky... another car... your hands...
Good. Now 4 things you can feel... the steering wheel... your seat... the seatbelt... your foot on the pedal...
3 things you can hear... the engine... the wind... any sounds outside...
2 things you can smell... just notice...
And 1 thing you can taste... or just notice your mouth...
You're here. You're present. You're safe. You're in control."
