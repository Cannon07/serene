# Quick Body Scan for Drivers

## Overview
A body scan helps you notice and release physical tension that builds up during anxious driving. This shortened version is designed for use while driving.

## Instructions
While keeping eyes on the road, mentally scan:

1. **Hands** - Are you gripping the wheel too tight? Soften your grip.
2. **Shoulders** - Are they up by your ears? Drop them down.
3. **Jaw** - Is it clenched? Let it relax, part your lips slightly.
4. **Forehead** - Is it furrowed? Smooth it out.
5. **Stomach** - Is it tight? Take a breath and let it soften.

## Why It Works
- Anxiety manifests physically in muscle tension
- Releasing tension sends "safe" signals to your brain
- Quick check-in prevents tension buildup
- Creates body awareness for earlier intervention

## Driving Tips
- Do this at red lights or in slow traffic
- Keep your eyes on the road
- Just notice and release - no need to close eyes
- Can be done in under a minute with practice

## Audio Script
"Let's do a quick body check while you drive.
First, notice your hands on the wheel. Are you gripping too tight? Soften your grip just a little.
Now your shoulders. Are they tense, up near your ears? Let them drop down and relax.
Check your jaw. If it's clenched, let it relax. You can part your lips slightly.
Your forehead - smooth out any furrowing.
And your stomach - if it's tight, take a breath and let it soften.
Good. Your body is releasing tension. This helps your mind relax too."
